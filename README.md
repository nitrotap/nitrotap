# nitrotap

Hi, I'm Kartik (@nitrotap)!   
I’m interested in data entry, android app development, and full stack web development. I’m currently learning Java on HyperSkill, and I'm enrolled in the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. (Finishing June 2022)

Reach out to me about Java, Full Stack Web Development, and Raspberry Pi.   
Thanks for stopping by :)
